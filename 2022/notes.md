# Notes

My thoughts on the puzzles for 2022

## Day 1 - Calorie Counting

Easy start! And a classic one. I should write a script to generate boilerplate
code.

## Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors

Spent 20 minutes trying to come up with a clever way to do it, then just wrote
out the hard-coded rules in 10 minutes to get the solution. Think you might be
able to create a matrix of the victory values and then do a matrix-vector
multiplication or something, didn't find the time to figure it out. Still no
boilerplate code script.

## Day 3 - Rucksack Reorganization

Reorganisation\*

Anyways, aside from that, it was pretty straightforward. Got rid of some loops,
tried to make a big smart code and ended up not doing that, instead just
solving the puzzle. Took a while to find how to turn a character into an
integer in Julia, will definitely forget this by next year again.

The boilerplate code script has not yet been written. Please check back
tomorrow.

## Day 4 - Camp Cleanup

No smart answers here! Forgot to check symmetrically for a while, but overall a
pretty easy day.

Still no boilerplate code script.

## Day 5 - Supply Stacks

Only pain. I did write the bash script to get some boilerplate code which is
nice. Day 5 itself threw me because I made a bad assumnption in my regex that
there would be only single digits. Aside from that, it wasn't that bad, it just
took me a while.
